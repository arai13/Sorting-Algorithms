# sorting-functions
This is a program coded in C++ which shows various methods of sorting a list of numbers. The implementations of some of these algorithms are much faster than others when dealing with big numbers, which makes even simple thing like sorting a list of number so interesting. The program allows you to generate a random array (larger arrays like with size 100000 work better for this) and then compare the time taken by each array to sort that array in an increasing order.

The different algorithms we plan to use in this program are:
- Insertion Sort (Done)
- Merge Sort (Done)
- Heap Sort
- Quick Sort
- Counting Sort
- Radix Sort
- Bucket Sort
