# sorting-functions
This is a program coded in C++ which shows various methods of sorting a list of numbers. The implementations of some of these algorithms are much faster than others when dealing with big numbers, which makes even simple thing like sorting a list of number so interesting. 

The different algorithms we plan to use in this program are:
<li>
<ul>Insertion Sort</ul>
<ul>Merge Sort</ul>
<ul>Heap Sort</ul>
<ul>Quick Sort</ul>
<ul>Counting Sort</ul>
<ul>Radix Sort</ul>
<ul>Bucket Sort</ul>
</li>
