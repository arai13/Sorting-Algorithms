# sorting-functions
This is a program coded in C++ which shows various methods of sorting a list of numbers. The implementations of some of these algorithms are much faster than others when dealing with big numbers, which makes even simple thing like sorting a list of number so interesting. 

The different algorithms we plan to use in this program are:
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort
- Quick Sort
- Counting Sort
- Radix Sort
- Bucket Sort
